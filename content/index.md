The goal of this website is to allow a reader with minimal math and cs background to fully* learn how state of the art SLAM systems work, primarily focusing on [FAST-LIVO2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14035). 

Most notes and explanations will be translated and based on the repo [FAST_LIVO2_Noted](https://github.com/cchester25/FAST_LIVO2_Noted) by Pan Feng. Many thanks for his herculean effort in annotating the paper, code, and hardware setup.
